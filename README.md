# Xender Web Ui Clone

This is a handmade xender web interface clone on it's initial version 1.0. The project has been realized using the following stacks : *ReactJs, TailwindCss and Material Ui*.

## How to run the app ?

* The first step it to clone the repository using the command *git clone respository_url_here*

* The second step is to install the project dependencies using the command *npm install*

* And finally now we can tun the app using the command *npm start*

### Note : 

- 1) The project is to be tested on desktop platforms because it is not yet responsive.

- 2) Only the Ui has been cloned, not the functionnalities

## Hope this gives you a little fun!!! :)
