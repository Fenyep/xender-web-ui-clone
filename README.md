# Xender Web Ui Clone

This is a handmade xender web interface clone on it's initial version 1.0. The project has been realized using the following stacks : *ReactJs, TailwindCss and Material Ui*.

## How to run the app ?

```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Fenyep/xender-web-ui-clone.git

# install the project dependencies
$ npm install

# run the app
$ npm start
```

## Test

You can easily test the app here : [xender web ui clone](der-web-ui-clone.vercel.app)

### Note : 

- The project is to be tested on desktop platforms because it is not yet responsive.

- Only the Ui has been cloned, not the functionnalities

## Hope this gives you a little fun!!! :)
